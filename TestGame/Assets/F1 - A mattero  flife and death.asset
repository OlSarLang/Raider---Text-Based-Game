  storyText: "The two norhumbrians unsheathe their daggers as you and the woman approaches.
    You make short work out of the first one, but the other managed to stab the woman
    and was now fleeing hastily.\r\nThis woman, who you had gotten fond of these past
    days was bleeding profusely. You do your best to clean the wound and stem the
    bleeding. It is best not to linger here anymore, you construct a small sled on
    which she can lay as you drag it behind you.\r\n\r\n1. Continue."
