  storyText: "You let her in and give her food and shelter. The next morning you wake
    up and she's sitting by the end of your bed. She sees you wake up and leans towards
    you, giving you a big kiss.\r\nNot many months go by before she is pregnant and
    starts shooting out offspring. You also learnt the language, so that's something.
    \r\nYou now have a fort of your own and a wife and children. It really turned
    out well for you, didn't it?\r\nNot really. You died of cancer after a couple
    of years.\r\n\r\n1. Win... Sorta."
