  storyText: "You run for the axe, but before you reach it, a sharp sting is felt
    in your back. You feel your energy leaving you, you fall down to your knees, your
    pulse fading away. You look down to only notice a sword sticking out from your
    belly, it retracts and you hear the person behind preparing for a hard swing.
    Decapitation now besets you, congratulations.\r\n\r\n1. End."
