  storyText: "Tackling the door as hard as you could on the attacker, his hand, shattered
    between the door and its frame, a shout of agony is let out. Sure to attract others.
    You reach the axe and move back to the person who is now kneeling and holding
    his hand, not a second of hesitant thoughts come to you as you hold your axe up
    high. With a swift blow to his skull, rendering his body limp. \r\n\r\nThe danger
    seems to over. But then you hear footsteps in the dark, lots of them. This place
    is no longer safe, RUN!\r\n\r\n1. RUN!"
