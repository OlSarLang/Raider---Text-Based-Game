  storyText: "You soon notice that your shipbuilding needs some improvements, as your
    first ship... Well, raft to be more accurate, rapidly sunk to the bottom of the
    sea. You refine your techniques and begin building a small dingy. It's turning
    out pretty well, you use some parts of a sail that washed up on the shore, as
    well as nails.\r\n\r\nDo you wish to set sail?\r\n\r\n1. Sail Ahoy!\r\n\r\n2.
    Sailing is not for me... Better off building a shelter."
