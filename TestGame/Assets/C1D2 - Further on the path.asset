  storyText: "Making your way further into the forest turned out to be a most daunting
    task, you feel your energy slowly draining and your head is becoming drowsy and
    your feet heavy.\r\nYou decide to walk away from the path to find a spot to rest,
    and possibly something to eat.\r\n\r\n*You find a few berries and proceed to sleep*\r\n\r\nThe
    night has passed, what little food you managed to find did not do much at all.
    The coast is the best place for you to go, there could possibly be more of your
    countrymen landing with their ships.\r\n\r\n1. Continue."
