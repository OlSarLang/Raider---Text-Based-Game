  storyText: "You jump straight at him, tackling him to the ground. He loses his sword
    as you both scuffle and throw punches all around. His arm got dislocated as he
    fell, you take notice and give him all you got. He soon stops resisting and you
    take his dagger and plunge it into his heart.\r\n\r\nStill close to the beach,
    you decide that you cannot linger and make your way deeper into the forest.\r\n\r\n1.
