  storyText: "Waiting for an opportunity did not seem fruitful. However, he stumbles
    and you take a step forward to try and hit him with your axe. As you did, your
    leg gave up, and you yourself fall to the ground. The attacker did not hesitate
    as he swung his sword across your abdomen, spilling your guts out on the ground.
    He then starts running back to the shore to help the rest.\r\n\r\nYou lay there,
    for a couple of minutes, slowly drowning in your own blood, not knowing when Odin
    comes. No one seemed to appear, you feel hopeless, godless, alone in a strange
    land, without family. Young as you were, fathering no children of your own, you
    leave this world forever.\r\n\r\n1. End. "
