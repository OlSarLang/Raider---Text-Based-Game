  storyText: "You hide behind some furniture in the dark corner. The man enters, and
    looks around. He then moves closer the the open fire...\r\nHe sits down at the
    table for short while, drowsing off. His head tilts forward, as if he was falling
    asleep. You decide to stand up and sneak towards the bed where your axe now is.\r\nJust
    as you reach your axe, the door swings open, a couple of soldiers enters and sees
    you. They yell and the soldier on the chair jumps up. They corner you and make
    short work of you. Throwing your lifeless body behind the hut.\r\n\r\n1. End."
