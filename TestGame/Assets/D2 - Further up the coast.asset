  storyText: "You finally found the coast again, a couple of kilometres from where
    you were shipwrecked. It seems quite, the sun is shining and there's not a soul
    around. You decide to build a small shelter just where the treeline begins, so
    to hide you better. You wait... Days pass... Nothing... \r\n\r\nA couple of parts
    from a ship washed up on shore. Maybe you could do something with them?\r\n\r\n1.
    Improve your shelter.\r\n\r\n2. Begin the creation of a boat"
