    you collapse in the forest.\r\nAn old one-eyed man wakes you up, looks at you,
    lets out a smile and says in your tongue - \"You cannot lay here all day son,
    there's still some use left in you\"\r\nHe takes you to nearby camp with only
    half a dozen of northmen. They hastily takes out their weapons and point them
    to you. -\"Who are you?!\".\r\n- \"I'm a northman, just as you. This man showed
    me to your camp\".\r\nThe northmen looks confused. - \"What man?\" they ask you.\r\nYou
    look around, confused. - \"He was here a moment ago...\"\r\n\r\n1. Continue"
