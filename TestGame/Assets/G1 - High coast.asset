  storyText: "The woman is feverish for a couple of days but eventually recovers.
    She thanks you and gives you a big kiss and a long hug. One of those hugs you
    give someone you fancy ;)\r\nThe coastline has now appeared. You are in the middle
    of nowhere, no roads for at least a couple of days. Making your way down to the

    nice here. She thinks so too. \r\n\r\n1. Ask her if she wants to bang\r\n\r\n2.
